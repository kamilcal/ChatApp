## About
FlashChat is a live messaging application for iOS using Swift and Google’s Firebase database service for backend support on securely saving user accounts and their personal chats. So reinstallation or any future updates will result in no user data loss. The application is designed and developed by applying the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.

## What did I use in this project 
-   Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager
-   Firebase Auth
-   Firebase FireStore as a cloud Database
-   Navigation controller
-   Tableview and Tableview cell using .Xib files
